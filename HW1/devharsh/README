The code doesn't work for following scenario:

./bbcp file.ext /target/foo/bar/sub/dir

as mkdir fails but it works for following scenario:

./bbcp file.ext /target/foo/bar/sub/dir/file2.ext

---

2 test cases are failing out of 25

localhost$ sh testcp.sh -p bbcp
Expected failure, but command returned 0:
  /home/dev/bbcp file file2
Files '/etc/passwd' and 'file' differ.
testcp.sh: 2/25 tests failed.

For these failing test cases I tried to read the symbolic link and get the targrt path but for me the target path was returning a blank string

my code is as follows:

	link_path = argv[2];
        len = readlink(link_path, target_path, sizeof(target_path)-1);
        if (len != -1) {
                target_path[len] = '\0';
                if (strcmp(argv[1], target_path) == 0) {
                        fprintf(stderr, "both files are same (no action)\n");
                        exit(1);
                }
        }
