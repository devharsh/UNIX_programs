Assembly language closely tied to processor architecture

At least four main types:

CISC: Complex Instruction-Set Computer
RISC: Reduced Instruction-Set Computer
DSP: Digital Signal Processor
VLIW: Very Long Instruction Word





The structure of a program in AT&T-syntax is similar to any other assembler-syntax, consisting of a series of directives, labels, instructions - composed of a mnemonic followed by a maximum of three operands. The most prominent difference in the AT&T-syntax stems from the ordering of the operands.

For example, the general format of a basic data movement instruction in INTEL-syntax is,

mnemonic	destination, source

whereas, in the case of AT&T, the general format is

mnemonic	source, destination
